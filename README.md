## Halloween Invites 2024

This project is digital invites for my 2024 Halloween party.
Invites are created using a template file (invite.html) and some javascript to add the
user-specific parts.

All in attendance received a black envelope in the post. Inside was a card with a ghost drawing on it, and an embedded
NFC chip. When users scanned the ghost with their phone, they were directed to their specific link.

## Can I Ride?
This project is a weather analyser for my morning commute. I often find that weather apps are overly pessimistic and dont give you the information you actually need.
This project aims to provide just the weather information I need for riding into work on my motorcycle.

## Optimistic Weather Forecast
This project is another "I hate how pessimistic weather forecasts are". It doesnt tell you it will be raining unless it actually is, it also says that 12 degrees is mild because in scotland you've got to take what you can get.
