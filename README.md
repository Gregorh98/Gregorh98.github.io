## Halloween Invites 2024

This project is digital invites for my 2024 Halloween party.
Invites are created using a template file (invite.html) and some javascript to add the
user-specific parts.

All in attendance received a black envelope in the post. Inside was a card with a ghost drawing on it, and an embedded
NFC chip. When users scanned the ghost with their phone, they were directed to their specific link.
